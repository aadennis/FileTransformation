Recording.
00:00:03 — Speaker 2
So we were doing a siren, weren't we?
00:00:05 — Speaker 2
But that was mainly for the upper stuff, wasn't it?
00:00:07 — Speaker 1
The siren — I think you decided that was gone because it was replaced.
00:00:13 — Speaker 2
Yeah, we completely scrubbed that one out.
00:00:15 — Speaker 1
Yeah.
00:50:15 — Speaker 2
But that was kind of—sorry, let me take that back. I'd obviously run that down before I scrubbed it out.
00:00:24 — Speaker 2
So the fried-clear-to-breathy was more for the falsetto, wasn't it?
00:00:28 — Speaker 1
Was, but...
00:00:30 — Speaker 1
I'm finding it's useful for me to understand how to get from fry to chest voice, and from fry to falsetto.
01:58:41 — Speaker 2
Yeah, which is great.
