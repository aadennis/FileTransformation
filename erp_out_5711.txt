1|1|Recording.|[00:00:01]
2|2|So we were doing a siren, weren't we?|
3|2|But that was mainly for the upper stuff, wasn't it?|
4|1|The siren, I think you decided that was gone because that was replaced.|
5|2|Yeah, we completely scrubbed that one out.|
6|1|Yeah.|
7|2|But that was kind of, but sorry, let me take, I'd obviously run that down before I'd scrubbed that out.|
8|2|So the fried clear to breathy was more for the falsetto, wasn't it?|
9|1|Was, but...|
10|1|I'm finding that it's useful for me to understand how can I get from fry to chest voice and from fry to falsetto.|
11|2|Yeah, which is great.|
12|1|Yeah.|
13|2|Which is great.|
14|2|But when you're trying to do moon river, like that kind of thing, depending on what tone you're going for, it may or may not be helpful.|
15|1|Yes, it was to try and get a bit of character into it, actually.|
16|1|Because I thought, wow, your voice is just sounding dull.|
17|1|It's not in tune.|
18|2|It's flat.|[00:01:01]
19|2|Okay.|
20|2|Okay.|
21|2|Well, let's play around with tone today.|
22|2|So let's look at breath and tone.|
23|2|Yeah, cool.|
24|2|Moon River.|
25|2|Moon River.|
26|2|On the wrong side.|
27|2|Let me know that tone.|
28|2|Do you feel warm?|
29|2|I'm.|
30|1|Fine.|
31|2|Singing as in sorry as in singing.|
32|1|I warmed up as ever.|
33|1|I like you to cast your opinion.|
34|1|Yes, sure.|
35|2|Always, always.|
36|2|Cool.|
37|2|So let's do some.|
38|2|Let's do some fries close breathy.|
40|2|Let's maybe do a literal first.|
42|2|Just to get us into it.|
43|2|Have you done any singing today?|
44|2|Yeah.|
45|2|A little bit.|
46|2|OK.|
47|2|So we're doing literal just for full range and then we'll crack on.|
48|2|So let's start down here.|
49|2|Cool.|[00:02:35]
50|2|Can you kind of hear that it was changing tone throughout?|
51|1|Yes, actually.|
52|1|Yeah.|
53|2|So does that normally happen at home?|
54|2|It's OK if it does.|
55|1|Recently, maybe.|
56|1|I'm not sure.|
57|2|That's OK.|
58|2|So if you go for like an imagine you're doing an in the mouth, so you're going to go.|
59|2|Obviously your lips are.|
60|2|So this is more to do with your tongue.|
61|1|Right.|
62|2|Yes.|
63|1|Can I just say in case you haven't gotten to know, two other things we did last week were.|
64|2|Yeah, the paradoxical breathing, yeah.|[00:03:04]
65|1|And the...|
66|2|Dropping the jaw.|
67|2|Yeah, so a bit of jaw stuff.|
68|2|Yeah, sorry, That's okay, don't worry.|
69|2|So when you're doing the...|
70|2|Yeah, so just make note of where your tongue is when you go...|
71|2|It's kind of just hanging out in the mouth.|
72|2|Somewhere in the middle.|
73|2|It's certainly not E.|
74|2|Agreed.|
75|2|Try E.|
76|2|E.|
77|2|It's sort of.|
78|1|Yeah, it's better.|
79|2|I try and do it without the lips.|
80|2|You can still feel it beating.|
81|2|Yeah.|
82|2|So we're going to go for an obviously we're not going to do the lips.|
83|2|We're going to go.|
84|2|Without the lips, so you basically the tongue, let's go, rather than think of the tongue being mid.|
85|2|So we're doing a lip trill, with the tongue in the middle.|[00:04:07]
86|1|Let me just think about where it normally is.|
87|2|It's probably mid there.|
88|2|Or let's think of like a dark sound.|
89|2|Yeah.|
90|2|As opposed to exactly the same notes.|
91|2|So keep it dark with that tongue in that sort of position.|
92|2|Keep it there.|
93|2|So don't change it.|
94|2|Nice.|
95|2|Could you feel it was wanting to change?|
96|2|So this is just for me to show you and actually this is what we're going to do within the tone of Moon River as well.|
97|2|So now imagine that you're going to make a really bright sound.|[00:05:01]
98|2|So the tongue might be quite high when you do it.|
99|2|So that tongue's quite high up your mouth.|
100|2|Can you feel the difference?|
101|2|So it's really bright.|
102|2|Can you feel when your tongue's up there that it sounds different to when your tongue's not?|
103|2|Yeah, the tongue moving just a little bit really affects the tone.|
104|1|Yeah, right.|
105|2|Same notes, same exercise.|
106|2|Yeah, they're not the tongue is moving.|
107|1|Right.|
108|2|Yeah, I just wanted to alert you to that just because it's quite nice to|
109|2|you can move around, but I think it's just being aware of what you're going for.|[00:06:01]
110|2|So you can maybe decide to go, right, today I'm going to do a dark tone, a darker tone, which I think that oohs through you.|
111|2|So we're going to, again, chill out.|
112|2|So the tongue isn't as high.|
113|1|Right.|
114|2|So mid to low.|
115|2|Yeah.|
116|2|And then we'll try it, maybe do it twice.|
117|2|Do one dark, one light.|
118|1|Yeah, okay.|
119|2|Yeah, one bright, one|
120|2|Rich.|
121|2|Okay.|
122|2|Yeah, yeah, yeah.|
123|1|Yeah.|
124|2|Yeah.|
125|2|So you're just aware of what you're doing.|
126|2|And then you can always go, okay, I'll do this one.|
127|2|Yeah, okay.|
128|2|And you can go between the two.|
129|2|And that's just you changing your tongue.|
130|1|Yeah.|
131|1|No, I think you're right.|
132|2|That always makes my nose really itchy.|
133|1|Yeah, because I want to have, yeah, I want to be, as you say, aware of what I'm doing.|
134|2|Yeah, absolutely.|
135|2|Okay, so let's go, let's do...|[00:07:05]
136|2|So we're going to go...|
140|2|You can feel the tongue starting high and then dropping down.|
141|2|Try, just for one, just do where the tongue isn't going up at the beginning.|
142|2|7, 8.|
143|2|Now do the tongue high.|
144|2|Almost sounds like you're doing you, doesn't it?|
145|2|Stay with it.|[00:08:05]
146|2|So can you stay with it?|
147|2|That's it, and you're going to lose volume as you get lower, and that's okay.|
148|2|It's okay to be quiet.|
149|2|Yeah, and it wants to change.|
150|2|That is not, the falsetto isn't in its happy place there.|
151|2|However, taking that falsetto a little bit lower than it naturally wants to go in terms of appropriateness, it's not that it's unachievable, it's just not in its happiest environment.|
152|2|It can really help with that blended sound, which is nice.|
153|2|Cool, Let's do...|
154|1|Can I just say, I was listening to Golden, the Korean K-pop.|
155|1|Yeah, the song at the moment.|
156|1|And as I was practicing...|
157|2|Were you singing to her key?|[00:09:01]
158|1|Yeah, no.|
159|1|But I was practicing flip, no, not the highest note.|
160|1|I could get the other notes, but it was useful for trying that flip.|
161|1|And did you see the live version?|
162|2|I've watched a bit of the film.|
163|1|So the point, the big deal is evidently, people were very impressed that in singing that she had bronchitis.|
164|2|When she sang it.|
165|1|When she sang it.|
166|1|But what she did, she adjusted it and her mates were great as brilliant.|
167|1|I know it was probably pre-recorded, but the mere fact, just, and a lovely story, you know the story of her?|
168|1|She was a K-pop reject.|
169|2|Yeah, So she spent 20 years, right?|
170|2|Sort of honing her craft, writing and stuff.|
171|2|And then all of a sudden she's become this.|
172|2|Yeah, it's a really nice story.|
173|1|In fact, she's relatively old.|
174|2|Well, how old is she?|
175|1|Well, yeah, but in K-pop world, she's ancient.|
176|2|Yeah, she's probably my age.|
177|2|Well, yeah, she's younger than me.|
178|2|She's younger than me.|
179|2|Yeah.|
180|2|Isn't that bonkers, though?|
181|2|She's just become this absolute mega.|
182|1|Lovely.|[00:10:02]
183|2|Yeah, she's got a cracking voice as well.|
184|1|Oh, it's amazing.|
185|1|Such a range.|
186|2|Why was she rejecting?|
187|1|Because you didn't fit the marketing.|
188|2|Like the aesthetic or whatever.|
189|2|Yeah, absolutely.|
190|2|Absolute BS, isn't it?|
191|2|Right, okay.|
192|2|What I would really like to do, actually, is sing Moon River.|
193|2|So you've already done a little bit at home anyway.|
194|1|Yeah.|
195|2|Sing Moon River.|
196|2|And then I want to do some breathing stuff after I've heard it.|
197|2|Is that okay?|
198|1|Yeah, thank you.|
199|2|Yeah, I'll connect.|
200|1|It was annoying.|
201|1|Well, not annoying, but it's just not a decent backing track on YouTube, on Spotify.|
202|1|So I've again hacked up my own one.|
203|1|But this time with an instrument.|
204|2|I prefer your ones.|
205|2|Turn that down.|
206|2|That sounded really excessively loud.|
207|2|I'll set the...|
208|2|So Bluetooth wise it's UE Mega Boom.|
209|2|Got the jungle drums on.|[00:11:02]
210|2|Yarp.|
211|2|Have you been watching the Hot Fuzz?|
212|2|No, it's been a while.|
213|2|Yarp.|
214|1|We were talking about that last time actually.|
215|1|Bluetooth.|
216|1|And what were you saying about it?|
217|1|Just the fact it's music.|
218|1|But yeah, it's a shame.|
219|1|He's the guy, so he's a bit of an **** in real life.|
220|2|Who is, sorry?|
221|1|Simon Pig.|
222|2|Oh, is he?|
223|2|Is he?|
224|1|Yeah, he's not well liked apparently.|
225|1|He's up his own a bit.|
226|1|It's.|
227|2|Such a shady smile.|
228|2|I do like Simon Pegg though.|
229|1|Yeah, he's funny.|
230|1|Okay, so I've got a 2 bar intro.|
231|2|Yeah.|
232|1|And then I start singing.|
233|2|I'm ready for you.|
234|1|Okay.|
235|1|I'll just just in case it helps you, there's the chords in the original.|
236|2|Thank you.|[00:12:01]
237|1|Okay.|
238|1|So...|
239|1|Sorry.|
240|1|Sorry, I screwed up.|
241|2|That's okay.|
242|2|That's all right.|
243|2|Don't worry.|
250|2|And then it repeats.|[00:14:19]
251|2|And then it repeats.|
252|2|Yeah.|
253|2|Nice.|
254|2|Great.|
255|2|Cool.|
256|2|So you've got quite a kind of ding, ding, ding, ding.|
257|1|Yeah.|
258|2|Like quite like.|
259|2|It's a vibe.|
260|1|Yeah.|
261|2|It feels kind of...|
262|1|Yeah, it's supposed to be...|
263|1|Well, you know what it's supposed to be.|
264|1|I just couldn't find it anymore.|
265|2|If I blinky ponce you.|
266|1|Yeah, great.|
271|2|Nice, we'll just go up to that.|[00:15:19]
272|2|Cool.|
273|2|So I think I'm going to lead you in a slightly different direction when it's something a bit more simple.|
274|1|Yeah, if you listen to the backing to the Frank Sinatra one, it's just an acoustic guitar.|
275|1|Yeah.|
276|1|And my acoustic guitar was in the Mendes at the moment.|
277|1|So, yeah, it's very simple.|
278|2|Yeah, Even if you just did one strum.|
279|1|Yeah, maybe.|
280|1|Yeah, River.|
281|2|I think it just needs to be simplified.|
282|2|Yeah.|
283|2|Only because like when I mentioned it, you're like, oh, it's all right.|
284|2|Like it didn't, it didn't seem right to me.|
285|2|I didn't know if you were going for a slightly more soft.|
286|1|It's a software instrument.|
287|1|That's the trouble.|
288|1|It's kind of limited in what you do.|
289|2|Yeah, of course.|
290|2|Also, sorry, is that on?|
291|1|That's software.|[00:16:01]
292|2|So that's software.|
293|1|That's not what you play.|
294|1|No, software.|
295|1|Yeah, what you do is you basically play it like a piano.|
296|1|And yeah.|
297|2|Oh, okay.|
298|2|Yeah, fair, fair, fair, fair.|
299|2|Got piano at home?|
300|1|Yes, I've got three.|
301|2|Three amazing.|
302|2|Can you play chords on the piano?|
303|1|Yeah.|
304|2|Just play the chords.|
306|2|That's what I think.|
307|2|Good idea, actually.|
308|2|Good idea.|
309|2|It doesn't need much rhythm.|
310|2|It doesn't need anything else.|
311|2|You can always move around the chord.|
313|2|You can just add in some notes.|
314|2|I mean, you can add in a couple of it, like it doesn't just improvise, like just move around where your fingers are.|
315|2|Yeah, I'll get my goals too.|
316|2|If you want a couple of extra things, you know.|
317|2|So in terms of how it feels.|
318|1|Yes.|
319|2|Talk to me.|
320|1|Not nice.|
321|1|Not nice.|
322|1|It's too, it's too, like so it's 80pm, that's the pace.|[00:17:00]
323|2|Yeah.|
324|1|And I'm just|
325|1|quivering too much at that kind of speed.|
326|2|When you say quivering, it feels unstable.|
327|1|Yes, yes.|
328|1|Exactly that.|
329|1|I feel that I don't have total control over the tuning.|
330|1|Now I should be able to hit the notes, but I'm having trouble.|
331|2|Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.|
332|1|So yeah.|
333|2|Okay.|
334|2|What happens|
335|2|If we play around with it first.|
336|1|Yeah.|
337|2|Right.|
338|2|Stability and you feel like you're struggling with pitching, isn't it?|
339|1|Yes, that's right.|
340|2|It doesn't sound like you're struggling with pitching, but it maybe just feels an effort.|
341|1|It's not so much an effort, but particularly when I play it back, I think, oh, that's off.|
342|1|Oh, okay.|
343|2|In what way?|[00:18:00]
344|2|Sharp?|
345|2|Flat.|
346|1|Flat.|
347|1|Particularly the opening bar.|
348|1|It settles down after that.|
349|1|But I guess it's kind of psychological or something.|
350|2|So let's play around with it first, see if anything makes it feel a bit easier.|
351|2|So you did this one.|
352|2|Did it make it feel easier when the arms were behind your head?|
353|2|Yes, So let's try it.|
354|2|So let's just do Moon River, Wider than Ma, and Crossing Moon Star Sunday.|
355|2|Just that one night with nothing.|
356|2|So don't put your arms behind your head for now.|
357|2|I just want to gauge how much, how better it feels.|
358|1|Right.|
359|2|Yeah?|
360|2|So you can tell me between one and 10.|
361|2|One's super easy, 10's really, really, really hard.|
362|2|You can tell me where it's sitting with no extra physical differences, right?|
363|2|Six, seven, eight.|
366|2|It's my fault.|[00:19:09]
368|1|Sorry, I've probably misaligned the chords.|
369|2|No, it's right.|
370|2|Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.|
371|2|Okay, cool.|
372|2|Ignore my piano playing.|
373|2|How did that feel between 1 and 10 in terms of everything that you talked to me about?|
374|2|Tone, stability, pitching.|
375|1|Halfway.|
376|2|So 5.|
377|1|Yeah.|
378|2|5?|
379|2|Okay, cool.|
380|2|Arms behind head for me.|
381|2|Five, I would try and be better.|
382|2|Seven.|
385|1|Sorry, what ends hard, easy?|
386|2|Tens hard ones, easy.|[00:20:00]
387|1|Right, so...|
388|1|Probably more to the three, but I am on that long note at the end, someday.|
389|1|I'm really struggling to hold that at a consistent level.|
390|1|Can you hold it?|
391|2|At a consistent level of volume, pitch, or air.|
392|1|Pitch.|
393|2|Pitch.|
394|1|So I'm going, Someday.|
395|1|That feels as though it's going all over the place.|
396|2|Do you feel like you're getting tense in your arms?|
397|1|No, it doesn't feel tense, but just it feels as though it's|
398|1|here that's kind of getting tense or am I imagining it?|
399|2|It doesn't sound it doesn't sound in unstable to me not hugely someday so what it sounds like to me is like you're getting this is still getting involved and it is|
400|2|Even though you're not feeling like there's pressure down, maybe that's what it is.|
401|2|So it doesn't look like that's squeezing in.|[00:21:03]
402|2|It looks like this is pushing you.|
403|2|And in turn, that's kind of staying out.|
404|2|So that's the paradoxical feeling.|
405|2|But this is going to add even more pressure here.|
406|2|So if you've got your vocal folds sitting here, if you're applying lots of pressure with the ribs, essentially, and the sternum,|
407|2|That's squeezing.|
408|2|The vocal folds are here doing their job.|
409|2|Here we go.|
410|2|There's loads of air coming up behind.|
411|2|And that, so if I do someday, like it changes the sound of it because I'm applying a lot of pressure.|
412|2|And it is affecting the tone because I think in a way everything's getting quite...|
413|2|Tense.|
414|2|Try this for me.|
415|2|So that's improving it.|
416|2|Try the shoulders for me, please.|[00:22:01]
417|2|Five, 6, 7.|
418|1|8.|
419|1|From top.|
420|2|Yeah, same line, 7, 8.|
421|1|Sorry, I'm thinking now more about breathing.|
422|1|Before I was taking quite, I was breathing in here, and then the aim anyway was to use a full line, but now I'm thinking about it, I'm finding a full line to get rid of the breath.|
423|2|We're not trying to get rid of the breath.|
424|1|Okay, fine, okay.|
425|2|I think that's it.|
426|2|Like, we're not trying to get rid of anything.|
427|1|Well, sure, but it's going to naturally come out at some point.|
428|2|It will come out.|
429|1|I tell you what.|
430|2|I'm going to get you to not think about the air for now.|
431|1|Okay.|
432|2|Is that okay?|
433|2|Yeah.|
434|2|Is that all right?|
435|2|Six, seven, eight.|
437|2|Nice, could you do it again?|[00:23:14]
438|2|Is that feeling easier just not thinking about breath?|
439|2|What was that number wise, just not thinking?|
440|1|Probably a three again.|
441|2|OK.|
442|1|But different variables.|
443|2|That's OK.|
444|2|Shoulders.|
445|2|Six, 7, 8.|
448|2|Thoughts.|
449|1|My thoughts are, can't help it, now I've got conscious effort of moving it from here.|
450|1|But yeah, that felt as though once I consciously remove the, so I guess I was thinking, yeah, you've got to keep it going, control it from up here, but you're not, you don't want to be doing that.|
451|1|Just let it flow.|[00:24:10]
452|2|Let it flow, let it flow, absolutely.|
453|2|Shoulders, if you could give it a number.|
454|2|That's obviously you can't then do that.|
455|1|Yeah.|
456|2|When you do this.|
457|1|Yeah, grudging 2.|
458|2|Why is it grudging?|
459|1|Because it's not that much better than the three.|
460|2|That's okay.|
461|2|Yeah, but listen, one is, you know...|
462|1|Yeah.|
463|2|That's a dream.|
464|2|One's a dream.|
465|2|Two is brilliant.|
466|2|Two is brilliant.|
467|1|Maybe I need to recalibrate?|
468|2|Cool,|
469|2|What happens now if you...|
470|2|What happens now if you half the volume?|
472|2|Yeah.|
474|1|Are we doing shoulders on those shoulders?|
475|2|No, nothing.|
476|2|Just half the volume for me, please.|
477|2|Turn it down a bit.|[00:25:00]
478|2|Six, seven, eight.|
482|1|So, more acceptable actually.|
483|1|It wasn't going like that, it was about meh, which is fine.|
484|1|So that's okay.|
485|1|So yeah.|
486|2|So could there be a correlation between trying hard and it feeling unstable?|
487|1|So to answer that a bit, so last night and this morning I was playing around a lot with loud versus soft to see what I did.|
488|1|Didn't seem to make a blind bit of difference at the moment, but you have waved your magic wand.|
489|1|And yeah, reducing the volume seems to make it easier right now.|[00:26:03]
490|2|Right now.|
491|2|Yeah, it's not going to be applicable to every song.|
492|2|Not going to be applicable to every song.|
493|1|I mean, just today on this one.|
494|2|Yes, Tomorrow on this song.|
495|2|It's nowhere near your upper range.|
496|1|No, that's right.|
497|2|But you do like to live up there and you do normally sing up there.|
498|2|It just does not require the same amount of intensity or energy.|
499|1|Yeah.|
500|1|And even though I like to live up there, I really want to master these things.|
501|2|Yes.|
502|2|But as a person, you are very much, I will do that.|
503|2|Like you're very, I'm the same.|
504|2|I'm going to do this.|
505|2|I'm going to, I'm going to go whole hog and I'm going to do that.|
506|2|It just doesn't need that approach.|
507|2|Less is more.|
508|2|Less is more.|
509|2|Essentially, moon river, it's not low for you.|
510|2|Some day down there, it probably is getting down to one of your lower notes.|
511|1|Yeah, that's right, tone lower.|[00:27:01]
512|2|Yeah, like I think if you got to here, you'd start getting...|
514|2|You can get down there, you absolutely can get down there, but what happened volume wise?|
515|1|The volume kind of disappeared as you got.|
516|2|It didn't disappear.|
517|2|You tried really hard to keep it there.|
518|2|was a point where it kind of really kind of, it sounded really comfy.|
519|2|And then you could tell, I could see you got to a point where you were like, I can't be that quiet.|
520|2|And you really went for it.|
521|2|And you can absolutely do that.|[00:28:00]
522|2|You don't have to.|
523|2|It's not your only option.|
524|2|And what I'm saying here is,|
525|2|You don't have to make that really, really loud.|
526|1|Yes, agreed.|
527|2|Especially in this song.|
528|1|Especially in this song, and especially if you've got a microphone.|
529|2|Exactly.|
530|2|Well, yeah, absolutely.|
531|2|Moon River wider than a mile.|
532|2|I'm crossing you in style someday.|
534|2|Doesn't need to be someday.|
535|1|Yeah, I mean, Frank Sinatra doesn't sing it loud.|
536|2|No, So I think it's embracing the natural order of things.|
537|2|We can go against that and sort of, we can find volume lower down should we so wish to.|
538|2|I just don't think we wish to at this point.|
539|1|Yeah, sure.|
540|2|Yeah?|
541|2|So when you get to someday...|
542|2|I'm going to make it your, just for now, to allow it to be quieter than the higher notes.|
543|1|Yeah.|
544|2|So we're going to go with it being half the volume-ish, because I'd say it's probably 3/4 of the volume, which is A-OK.|
545|2|I'm all right with you landing somewhere between what I was saying and what you were doing before.|[00:29:06]
546|2|That's usually what happens.|
547|2|So|
548|2|Yeah, it's still aimed for that half a volume, so the way you just did it and allowing that last note to be the quieter one.|
549|1|Yeah, so sorry, last throughout was I too louder than you asked for?|
550|1|No, it's okay.|
551|2|No, I was aiming for you to be quieter.|
552|1|Yeah.|
553|2|And you were, which was great.|
554|2|And you can have the shoulders in, yeah, if you want to.|
555|2|Yeah.|
558|1|Yeah, it's a good option.|[00:30:03]
559|1|It's yeah, I think so.|
560|2|I'd say it's a more appropriate option.|
561|1|Yeah, I think you're right.|
562|2|And then you can, you don't have to stay quiet for the whole thing.|
563|2|You didn't on the Moon River, you kind of lifted it and it wants that.|
564|2|musical part of me wants it to go, but it just doesn't need it lower down.|
565|2|Do you know what I mean?|
566|2|What happens if you do it on an mmm and you chew?|
567|2|So you're going to go mmm, keeping it exactly the same volume.|
568|2|You do not need to overcompensate for the fact that your mouth is shut.|
569|2|It will sound even quieter.|
570|2|Nice.|[00:31:02]
571|2|Okay, we're going to do, see if you can do what we were talking about a little bit last time, so dropping that jaw.|
572|2|Did we do the little wiggle?|
573|1|I'm not sure we did the wiggle.|
574|1|The thing that I remember most was I was not symmetrical, so I'm over to take a look at that.|
575|2|We're going slightly to the side, that's okay.|
576|2|So when you're dropping the jaw, just be really mindful that these muscles|
577|2|So that might not be your relaxed jaw.|
578|2|So that might, your relaxed jaw might be this.|
579|2|Do you know what I mean?|
580|1|I am stretching it.|
581|2|Yeah, don't stretch it for now.|
582|1|Okay.|
583|2|So go completely gormless, like, I don't know.|
584|2|I swear I watch TV like that.|
585|1|Yes.|
586|2|Especially if it's been a hard day with the kids, I'm like.|
587|1|Oh my God.|
588|2|I can't go on.|
589|2|It's how I used to look in physics.|
590|2|I was not good at physics.|
591|1|Shame on you.|
592|2|Were you good at physics?|[00:32:00]
593|2|No.|
594|1|I was all right.|
595|2|I was good at the other sciences.|
596|2|Not that one.|
597|2|Not that one.|
598|1|Biology was my hate.|
599|2|I loved biology.|
600|2|I really liked biology.|
601|2|But I mean, I lived for art and drama and music.|
602|2|I took as many of those as I could.|
603|2|But yeah, physics, I have no idea what's going on.|
604|2|And ironically, I use it a lot now.|
605|1|Yeah, you do, don't you?|
606|2|Like sound, right?|
607|2|But it takes me a long time to get it.|
608|2|So we're going to drop the jaw.|
609|2|And we're just going to wiggle it a little bit just to keep it from getting tense.|
610|2|So yeah, before it was too wide.|
611|2|Muscles were getting involved.|
612|2|We don't want those muscles involved.|
613|2|because those are the chewing muscles and they will get tense here, whether you're doing this or doing that.|
614|2|So we just want to eliminate that and go really slack and gormous.|
615|2|And we go around.|
616|2|You can look if it's helpful or if it puts you off.|
617|2|Most people are like, I don't want to.|
618|2|Yeah, I don't want to sing that.|
619|2|Yeah, fair.|
620|2|I don't really think I want to look quite something either.|
621|2|So you got moon river.|[00:33:00]
622|2|That's it, so try and articulate.|
625|2|Has gone up into the next.|
626|2|Right, so stop there.|
630|2|Yeah, that's back in your mouse.|
634|2|We want it to go a bit louder, which is okay.|[00:34:24]
636|2|Sorry, I got a camera.|
639|2|Did that feel?|
640|1|Yeah, it felt as though it did have an effect on just making it feel a bit better, easier.|
641|2|Moon, moon, moon.|[00:35:02]
642|2|It wants to go moon, moon, moon.|
643|2|So moon, it wants to do that because if you really think about it, your teeth are quite close together on the moon at the moment.|
644|1|Right.|
645|2|So can you cheat?|
646|2|Moon.|
648|2|Can you hear that's gone into those?|
649|2|Moon.|
650|2|So remember we're half the volume, half the volume.|
652|2|So you can take the thumb out if you want.|
653|2|Six, keep the note, six, seven, half the volume.|
655|2|Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.|[00:36:14]
656|2|So I would keep doing the mms and the chews.|
657|2|Singing with thumb in your mouth.|
658|2|OK.|
659|2|Singing with the nose pitch.|
660|1|Yeah.|
661|2|It wants to pop into the nose occasionally.|
662|1|Yeah, on the consonants, yeah.|
663|2|The consonants will do that anyway, so moon.|
666|2|Yeah, So in some consonants it will go anything where bilabial where your lips shut.|
668|2|Where your both lips come together, it will go into the nose because you've shut the mouth, right?|
669|2|Yeah.|
670|2|I'm A-OK with that.|
671|2|is just articulating.|
672|2|Yeah.|
673|2|However, we're getting...|
674|1|Thank you.|[00:37:02]
675|2|Yeah.|
676|2|Yeah.|
678|2|You're having to force it out of the mouth.|
679|2|So it's that whole thing of, do you remember the hingis that we did?|
680|2|Oh yeah.|
681|2|So the hingi, moon rivers, that soft palate side.|
685|2|You then do half of what you're currently doing?|
686|2|In terms of, in terms of volume.|
687|2|Six, seven, eight.|
688|2|So releasing into something different.|
689|2|So it's more almost like softer and breathier.|
690|2|Yeah.|
692|2|Cool.|
693|2|I think we might look at that next time.|
694|2|So get some breath stuff and if we have time we might do a little bit of that.|[00:38:02]
695|2|So it's basically it's a tone thing.|
696|2|So I'm going to pop that there.|
697|2|Right aware that your phone's on it so I don't want it to fall off.|
698|2|There we go.|
699|2|But we're going to lie on the floor.|
700|2|Okay.|
701|2|So I'm going to move that.|
702|2|Actually it might be easier and safer.|
703|2|Hold on to that.|
704|2|Let's pop it over there.|
705|2|There you go.|
706|2|So we're going to lie on the floor, feet facing that way.|
707|2|Should have dried from the rain.|
708|2|So paradoxical breath wise, tell me if you have any back pain, if it's going to be hard or anything.|
709|1|My watch tells me I'm 57 years old.|
710|1|Oh, brill.|
711|1|I'm quite pleased.|
712|2|It's what, sorry.|
713|1|I'm quite pleased about that.|
714|1|You're quite pleased.|
715|1|Nearly sixty-nine.|
716|2|Oh, well done.|
717|2|Well done.|
718|2|That's very good.|
719|2|My watch will probably tell me I'm about 50.|
720|2|That's it.|
721|2|Oh, God.|
722|2|How does your watch tell you that?|
723|2|What kind of watch do you have?|
724|1|It's a Garmin.|
725|1|It takes, you know, blood readings and stuff.|
726|2|Oh, right, yeah, My heart rate's always pretty good.|[00:39:01]
727|2|It's usually around 55, 60.|
728|2|Yeah, it's good.|
729|2|Yes, I'm like, I know it's all right.|
730|2|so.|
731|2|She's going to breathe, okay?|
732|1|So if we're bringing, filling, filling some.|
733|2|Bringing a natural breath.|
734|2|Yeah.|
735|2|And again.|
736|2|So I've turned the lights off because it's hideous when you're lying down here.|
737|2|And actually the other day I was doing this and my eyesight went all weird.|
738|2|I had a kaleidoscope with it for one eye.|
739|2|I was like, I'm not doing that to anyone else.|
740|2|Right, so we're going to make an mmm sound.|
741|2|So we're going to go.|
742|2|On whatever note you like, whichever note feels comfortable.|
743|1|Okay.|
744|2|Nice and then again.|
745|2|Then whenever you feel ready.|[00:40:01]
746|2|Another one.|
747|2|That's really, really good.|
748|2|Cool.|
749|2|So this time we're going to do.|
751|1|Am I going it wrong?|
752|2|It's like a go.|
754|2|Yeah, I go.|
756|2|Your distant lawn mower, that kind of sound.|
757|2|Relax your shoulders wherever you can.|
758|2|Nice.|
759|2|And one more time.|
760|2|Breathe in whenever you're ready.|
761|2|Nice.|[00:41:13]
762|2|So you can let that go whenever you're ready.|
763|2|Cool.|
764|2|So we're going to go.|
765|2|So 3 individual ones.|
766|2|And again.|
768|2|Good, and again.|
769|2|One more time.|
770|2|Nice.|
771|2|That's working really, really nicely.|
772|1|Okay.|
773|2|Really, really, really, really good.|
774|2|Really, really good.|
775|2|Cool.|
776|2|We're going to stand up.|
777|1|How do we actually pull?|
778|1|Where is it to be?|
779|2|So what's happening is, so I'll show you what's happening is, I've got this waistcoat on this.|
780|2|So what we're looking for is this.|
781|2|So the belly's going, and you can kind of see that going up and down.|
782|1|Right.|
783|2|Can you see that?|[00:42:00]
784|1|Yeah.|
785|2|That's useful.|
786|2|What was happening before was...|
787|1|Can you see that?|
788|2|When you're stood up.|
789|1|Yeah.|
790|2|Okay.|
791|2|Right.|
792|2|So when we're singing, so I just want to go back to the song after we've done that.|
793|2|There we go.|
794|2|I'm still with your phone.|
795|2|Thank you.|
796|2|I will not break someone else's phone.|
797|2|Could you do it on a shush, actually?|
798|2|So imagine you're still on the floor.|
799|2|So if the floor felt quite comfortable to you, what you can do is if you keep soft knees, you can kind of lean against the wall.|
800|2|Not lean, but yeah.|
801|2|So you have your head there.|
802|2|So if you imagine, so you've got that.|
803|2|Six, 7, 8.|
804|2|Could you, if your head's against the wall, just, yeah, like that.|[00:43:02]
805|2|So at the moment, is that that, like you're...|
806|1|Like, sorry, is this correct?|
807|2|Yeah, Otherwise it's, that's the posture, which just crushes the spine there and stretches everything in.|
808|2|Six, 7,|
809|2|Can I make this need to be loud?|
810|2|Cool.|
811|2|Could you do it one more time?|
812|2|Half that volume.|
813|2|Keep the shh.|
814|2|So you won't need that much air, maybe.|
815|2|Six, 7, 8.|
818|2|Just singing it for me.|[00:44:05]
819|2|You can stay against the wall.|
822|1|Yeah, that felt, yeah, that felt as though, control isn't the word, but it didn't feel as though it's wobbling is how it felt.|
823|1|It's like unstable.|
824|1|Yeah.|
825|2|Cool, cool, cool, cool.|
826|2|When you do moon river, it feels like you're really holding on.|
827|2|what happens air wise.|
828|2|So it's not a volume thing.|
829|2|It's a vocal fold thing actually.|
830|2|Moon River wider than a mile.|
831|2|OK.|[00:45:06]
832|2|So do you remember we did on sets?|
834|2|A while back.|
835|2|Let's just really quickly recap those.|
836|2|So you can stay on the wall or you can|
837|2|Step away, just be careful of that.|
838|2|We're slightly doing that again.|
839|2|So make sure it's that part of the head that's on the floor.|
840|2|That's it.|
841|2|And keep those knees soft so we're not really upright like a soldier.|
842|2|Hopefully it just feels quite comfy.|
843|2|We're going to do the onsets, but I'm going to do it down here.|
844|2|Let's do it here, actually.|
845|2|We're going to, no, we'll do it here.|
846|2|Sorry, being really indecisive.|
847|2|So your attractive state is, yeah, glottal.|
849|2|Oh, actually, no, smooth, wasn't it?|
850|2|Smooth and staccato almost.|[00:46:00]
851|2|So we're going to do, let's do a brat.|
852|2|So we're going to go, A, E, A, O.|
853|2|That's it.|
854|2|And again.|
857|2|Always hear that, the breath.|
858|2|It feels quite held.|
860|2|Ah, eh, ee, oh, ooh Back down.|
861|2|Ah, eh, ee, oh, ooh Can you feel that?|
862|2|Ah, eh, ee, oh, ooh That feeling of it being quite held, does that feel quite familiar?|
866|2|To do...|
869|2|Nice.|[00:47:01]
870|2|That was lovely.|
871|2|So that was an aspirate abrupt.|
872|2|So that was slightly breath.|
873|2|It's like breath before sound, whereas the abrupt one was.|
874|2|I'm going to hold it to the very last moment and then I'm going to let them both out at the same time.|
875|2|Yep.|
876|2|Whereas this is ha, hey, breath first.|
877|2|We're going to do breath first and then continue that breathy tone.|
878|2|So it'll go ha, hey, he, ho, ho.|
879|2|So it's all breathy.|
880|2|7, 8.|
882|2|That's it.|
883|2|So you might end up being in the thinner vocal cords, which is fine.|
884|2|And it will be quiet.|
885|2|So letting that happen.|
886|2|So that's wanting to go abrupt, all breathy.|
887|2|So it's wanting to go, yeah, but just less.|
888|2|So for a shorter period of time, but keep it all breathy.|[00:48:00]
889|2|You can't push loads of air out, otherwise it all...|
890|2|Either clear up.|
891|2|So it's just being kind of slow and low, which is something you said earlier.|
892|2|Seven, eight.|
893|2|Yeah, you got it.|
894|2|Kind of sounds like dying breath kind of stuff, doesn't it?|
895|2|Mind your head.|
896|2|Good, and again.|
898|2|So if we do, we're going to do it on a hoo, we're going to go, hoo, all of an hoo, but slightly breathy.|
899|2|So breathy the whole way through, aspirate gradual, the whole thing's going to breathy.|
900|2|Starts with breath,|[00:49:03]
901|2|Stays with breath, ends with breath.|
902|2|You might need to breathe more.|
903|2|It's okay.|
904|2|But this is just an exercise.|
905|2|I'm not saying that you'd necessarily sing it like this, but just to free it up a little.|
906|2|Six, 7, 8.|
907|2|So just an ooh.|
908|2|A ooh the whole time.|
909|2|Six, 7, 8.|
911|2|Yes, we don't need to push it out.|
913|2|It's like it's almost like the breath is like suspended.|
914|2|That's it now.|
915|2|Good, and breathe again.|[00:50:05]
916|2|Nice.|
917|2|Now just sing the words.|
918|2|Just sing it, and we're aiming for that kind of soft.|
919|2|Be careful of that head leaning against.|
920|2|You can stand up if you want to.|
921|2|Take a step away.|
922|2|Six, and you can let go of the hands.|
923|2|Six, 7, let go of that breath.|
924|2|Go straight away.|
925|2|Ready for an abrupt, yeah?|
926|2|We don't need that much and we're going for soft anyway.|
927|2|We're not necessarily going for a completely aspirate thing, we're just going to see how it's affected it.|
928|2|Six, 7, 8.|
929|2|So we're just singing it again.|
930|2|We're not trying to sing it like aspirin.|
931|1|Okay.|[00:51:00]
932|2|Yeah, we're just singing it.|
933|2|We want to see how it's affected it.|
939|1|Um, yeah, it...|
940|1|me, I have to go away and work on it, but I'm getting a hint of something different that's a bit of practice.|
941|2|It's different.|
942|2|I think it's just, obviously we went really breathy.|
943|2|I'm not saying that that's what we do.|
944|2|So it's just to kind of, it's kind of to steer you off a habit.|[00:52:02]
945|2|Does that make sense?|
946|2|So, it's you're doing exercises in order to affect the overall sound, rather than it sound like that exercise.|
947|1|Does that make sense?|
948|1|Yeah, it does.|
949|1|And what's interesting is I realise I've got a kind of canister that's waiting to explode most of the time, and I'm just trying to let out little bits of breath, whereas actually...|
950|1|I need to change my thinking, or at least have a go at changing my thinking.|
951|2|Yeah, So I'm fine.|
952|2|It sounds very different.|
953|1|Yeah, it does.|
954|2|So if I take it up a little bit, because I can't sing quite.|
955|2|So if I went...|
956|2|So it'd be here.|
957|2|So it'd be here if I went...|
958|1|Yeah, that's right, that's right.|
959|2|Whereas if I went...|
960|1|Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.|
961|2|It's very different.|[00:53:00]
962|2|And actually it's a lot more free.|
963|2|So I think for you, rather than thinking, I need to let more air out, because I think in a way that's going to maybe make you go, I do it that way.|
964|2|I think for you, exercise, so the exercise is very good for you.|
965|2|And to practice your paradoxical breathing.|
967|2|You can zhush things on the floor so that you've got that happening instead of that happening.|
968|2|But I think there is probably a large portion of, if you're holding it in, that maybe that's why that's happening as well.|
969|2|Yeah.|
970|2|So freeing up, that's absolutely not the page.|
971|2|I've turned it too many times.|
972|2|So you're not doing the Wizard of Oz.|
973|2|So moving the shoulders, again, you can't, that feeling of frees that up a little bit, which is why that's feeling easier.|
974|2|So it's almost like a holding of the breath.|[00:54:00]
975|2|Holding of the breath, which is a buildup of pressure.|
976|1|Yeah, that's right.|
977|2|Which actually, I think in a way that's what's going to help you more.|
978|2|So you can absolutely practice.|
979|2|I think that's why|
980|2|it kind of looks like that, just because you're holding on to it.|
981|2|I think if we can get out of that, then that's helpful.|
982|1|Maybe I'm too kind of concerned about compression.|
983|1|And also something I noticed there was when I'm singing Breathy Like That, there's more of a want and quieter, more of a want to go to falsetto.|
984|2|Which is okay.|
985|1|Yeah, yeah, sure.|
986|2|Do you know what I mean?|
987|2|Like it's kind of...|
988|2|on this like it might be utterly appropriate.|
989|1|Yeah.|
990|2|So what we're going to look at is next time I see you.|
991|2|So even more to keep up exercises that keep the air flowing.|
992|1|Yeah.|[00:55:03]
993|2|So you've got with quite a high content and quite gentle in that respect.|
994|2|So it's not it's not that it's.|
995|2|So you can feel the difference between...|
996|1|Yeah, sure.|
997|1|So if I just think that's it, isn't it?|
998|2|But not like a like a very...|
999|2|I don't know, maybe you are being Edith Pierre.|
1000|2|Do you know what I mean?|
1001|2|That kind of...|
1002|2|It's a soft rather than a...|
1003|2|Does that make sense?|
1004|2|Because that creates something different.|
1005|2|in the throat.|
1006|2|So we've got a which is soft.|
1007|2|We've got we'll do some more things as well.|
1008|2|So we did Aspera on set.|
1009|1|What was the one thing we did before?|
1010|2|We did.|
1011|2|I think sometimes when you just kind of.|[00:56:01]
1012|1|Go.|
1013|1|But has a better value, do you think?|
1014|2|Yeah, because it's a high air frozen.|
1015|2|That might even make it work for you.|
1016|2|I'm just getting it moving, but then just singing the songs.|
1017|2|I don't then want you to think, I need to do it like this.|
1018|2|You don't.|
1019|1|I know I don't, but I'm looking for ways...|
1020|1|To be less disappointed with my voice, please don't.|
1021|2|Be disappointed in your voice.|
1022|2|You have an amazing voice.|
1023|2|It just fades.|
